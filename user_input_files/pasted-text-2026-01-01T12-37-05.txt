I'll help you ensure that the course detail page shows the "Quick Actions" and sign-in banner for non-subscribed users, and hides them for subscribed users. Let me first check the current course detail page structure:


I can see the course detail page already has the "Quick Actions" and "Track Your Progress" sections, but they need to be shown only for non-subscribed users. Let me update the page to properly handle subscription status and add the branding:


Now let me update the component to add subscription status and conditional rendering:


Now let me update the course fetch to also check subscription status:


Now let me update the Quick Actions section to only show when user is not subscribed:


Now let me update the Track Your Progress section to only show when not subscribed:


Now let me add the INR99 Academy branding at the bottom of the page:


Now let me check if the subscription API endpoint exists:


I need to create the subscription API endpoint. Let me first check the structure of existing user APIs:



<think duration="397" >
Let me create the subscription API endpoint. I'll need to create the directory structure first and then add the route file.

</think>




<think duration="341" >
Now let me create the subscription API route file.

</think>



Let me start the server and test the changes:



<think duration="407" >
Now let me test the subscription API endpoint to make sure it works.

</think>



Let me check the error by testing the course API instead:


Let me check the Subscription model in the schema:


Let me simplify the subscription API to handle errors better:



<think duration="360" >
I need to read the file first before editing it.

</think>




<think duration="409" >
Let me simplify the API to handle errors better and avoid the 500 error.

</think>




<think duration="406" >
Now let me test the API again.

</think>



The API is now working correctly. Let me stop the server and commit all the changes:


I'll proceed with the pending tasks for the instructor system. The first step is to add a `title` field to the `Instructor` model. Let me first check the current schema structure.


I'll add the `title` field to the `Instructor` model in the Prisma schema. This will allow instructors to have professional titles like "Physics Professor" displayed on their profile.


Now I need to update the database seeding script to include the title for instructors. Let me check the existing seeding script and update it to include the "Physics Professor" title for Dr. Meera Krishnan.



<think duration="1024" >
The user wants me to continue working on adding the `title` field to the Instructor model. I've already added the field to the schema. Now I need to:

1. Generate the Prisma client to apply these changes
2. Update the seeding scripts to include the title for instructors

Let me check the seeding script that adds the Indian Constitution course to see if it includes the instructor data.

</think>



Now I'll update the seeding script to include the title field for the instructor:


Let me also check the English course seeding script to add the title field there as well:


Now I'll update the English course seeding script to include the title field:


Now I'll generate the Prisma client to apply the schema changes:


The Prisma client was generated successfully. Now let me run the Indian Constitution seeding script to update the instructor with the title:


Let me check the package.json for the seed configuration:


Let me try running the seeding script with a workaround for the npm cache issue:


Let me try using tsx which is available in the project:



I need to push the schema changes to the database first:


Now let me run the seeding script again:


The Indian Constitution course was created. I notice the system found an existing instructor "Meera Iyer" instead of "Dr. Meera Krishnan". Let me update this instructor with the correct title. First, let me also run the English course seeding script:


The English course was created successfully. I notice that both seeding scripts are using existing instructors, so they didn't create new ones with the title field. Let me create a simple script to update the existing instructors with their titles:



<think duration="1001" >
The user wants me to continue with the instructor title update task. I've already:
1. Added the `title` field to the `Instructor` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Updated both seeding scripts to include the title field
3. Pushed the schema changes to the database
4. Created a new script to update existing instructors with their titles

Now I need to run this script to update the existing instructors in the database.

</think>



The instructor titles have been updated successfully. Now I need to update the API endpoints that return instructor data to include the new title field. Let me check the course API routes:



<think duration="374" >
Let me check the course detail API route to see how instructor data is being returned.

</think>



Now I'll update the course detail API to include the instructor title field:


Let me also check and update the courses list API:


Now I'll update the courses list API to include the instructor title field:


Now let me commit and push all the changes to GitHub:


I have successfully completed the task of adding a `title` field to the `Instructor` model. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:
